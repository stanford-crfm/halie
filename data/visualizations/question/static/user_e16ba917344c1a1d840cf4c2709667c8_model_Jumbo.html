This theory assumes that all factors of production, including labour, are fully mobile.  However, in reality, capital, labour and raw materials are not fully mobile.

A trade agreement between countries will almost always benefit both countries. International trade is good for a country. Barriers to trade are irrational. The benefits of trade are dispersed over many people, but the costs of trade are concentrated. International conflict prevents trade, so trade should be restricted.
