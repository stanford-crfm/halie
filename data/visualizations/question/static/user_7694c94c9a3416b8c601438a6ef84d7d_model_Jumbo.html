The water soluble vitamins are C and B complex. The fat soluble vitamins are absorbed in the small intestines, so when the diet is high in fat, more fat soluble vitamins are absorbed. The water soluble vitamins are absorbed in the small intestines, so when the diet is high in fiber, more water soluble vitamins are absorbed.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: D</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Before Nixon resigned how many believed he should be removed from office?</b><br>A: 79%<br>B: 98%<br>C: 33%<br>D: 57%<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Before Nixon resigned how many believed he should be removed from office?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Before Nixon resigned how many believed he should be removed from office?  Answer  The Watergate scandal was a series of political scandals that occurred in the United States in the 1970s. The initial scandal involved the 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and President Richard Nixon's administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement.
