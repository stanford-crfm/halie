Deuterium chloride has a different electron distribution than hydrogen chloride, which results in a different dipole moment. Additionally, the force constant of deuterium chloride is different than that of hydrogen chloride, which also contributes to the difference in their infrared absorption frequencies. Finally, the reduced mass of deuterium chloride is different than the reduced mass of hydrogen chloride, which also</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: Cobalt-60 is used in the radiation therapy of cancer and can be produced by bombardment of cobalt-59 with which of the following?</b><br>A: Neutrons<br>B: Alpha particles<br>C: Beta particles<br>D: X-rays<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: A</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Cobalt-60 is used in the radiation therapy of cancer and can be produced by bombardment of cobalt-59 with which of the following? neutrons, alpha particles, beta particles, x-rays</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Neutrons</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: A</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?</b><br>A: Irrationality on the part of the leadership<br>B: Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed<br>C: Regime type<br>D: International conflict prevents trade<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: B</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market? irrational leadership, concentrated costs and dispersed benefits, regime type, international conflict</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: 1. Irrational leadership: Leaders may pursue protectionist policies for reasons that have nothing to do with economics, such as political favoritism or the desire to protect domestic firms from foreign competition.  2. Concentrated costs and dispersed benefits: Protectionist policies often benefit a small number of firms or workers at the expense of the majority of consumers and producers. This is because the costs of protectionism are often concentrated in specific industries, while the benefits are spread out across the economy.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: A</div><br><hr>
