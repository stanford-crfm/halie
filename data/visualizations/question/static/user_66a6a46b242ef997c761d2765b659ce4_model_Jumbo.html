SORT is a treaty between Russia and the United States to reduce the number of their strategic nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles. The treaty is set to expire in 2012. SORT is a successor agreement to the 1991 START Treaty, which expired in December 2009. SORT is set to expire in 2012.

HDL Cholesterol and Why Is It Important? High density lipoprotein or HDL, is considered the “good” cholesterol. HDL is often referred to as “good” cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from the arteries to the liver, where cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body. High levels of HDL cholesterol have been shown to reduce the risk for heart disease. HDL cholesterol levels are influenced by several factors including age, smoking, gender, and genetics. HDL levels tend to decrease with age. Low HDL cholesterol levels may be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as kidney or liver disease.

The fission process in nuclear reactors produces a large amount of heat, which turns water into steam. The steam then turns turbines which produce electricity. This electricity powers the coolant pumps that cool the reactor. The coolant pumps are powerful, but they use electricity.    The coolant pumps use electricity, but they produce heat. That heat is transferred to the reactor, which heats up the coolant. The heated coolant then circulates through the reactor, transferring its heat to the fuel rods.

It is made by bombarding cobalt-59 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Cobalt-59 is a stable isotope, but when it is hit by a neutron, it becomes cobalt-60, which is unstable and radioactive.  Cobalt-60 is used to treat cancer. It destroys cancer cells by emitting high-energy gamma rays. The gamma rays are a form of radiation that can destroy cancer cells without harming healthy tissue.  Cobalt-60 is also used in industrial radiography, a process where radiographic film is exposed to radiation.
