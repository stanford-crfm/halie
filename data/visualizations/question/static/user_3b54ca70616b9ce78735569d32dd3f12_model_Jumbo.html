A central aspect of the 2008-09 global financial crisis was the recognition that economies and markets had become overly reliant on debt. This column argues that policymakers must address the debt overhang problem, but must do so in a way that does not impede the recovery. The eurozone crisis has focused attention on the need for fiscal coordination in monetary unions. This column argues that fiscal discipline requires more than rules. It requires credible enforcement, which depends on institutional design.
