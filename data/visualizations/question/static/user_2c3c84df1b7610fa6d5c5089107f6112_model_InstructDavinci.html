The infrared absorption frequency of deuterium chloride is shifted from that of hydrogen chloride due to the difference in the electron configurations of the two molecules. Deuterium has an extra neutron in its nucleus, which causes the electron configurations of the two molecules to be different. This results in a shift in the absorption frequency of the infrared light.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: A</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: The supplementation of diet with which fat soluble vitamins has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease?</b><br>A: Vitamin A and D<br>B: Vitamin A and K<br>C: Vitamin D and E<br>D: None of the above<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Cardiovascular disease can be reduced with dietary supplementation of fat soluble vitamins such as</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: A, D, and E  There is some evidence that suggests that supplementation with fat soluble vitamins, such as A, D, and E, may help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
