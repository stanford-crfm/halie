I'm not sure what you mean by "travel." Electrical current does not travel along a wire, it is a flow of electrons through the wire.  You may be referring to the fact that the resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. A wire with a large cross-sectional area has a low resistance. The resistance of a wire is proportional to the length of the wire and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.
