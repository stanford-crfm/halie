There are 20 different amino acids. Nine of these are called "essential amino acids" because the body cannot make them from other compounds. These essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Proteins are an important part of every cell in the body. They are used to make muscles, bones, skin, hair, and nails. They also help repair cells and tissues. Proteins help the body fight infection, and are an important part of the immune system. Proteins from animal sources, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and yogurt, are called "complete proteins"</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: dietary protein excess problem ?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Is glutamine supplementation needed in catabolic patients?
