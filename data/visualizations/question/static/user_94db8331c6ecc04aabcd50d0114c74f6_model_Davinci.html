It was the first treaty to cut nuclear weapons. It reduced the number of nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia could deploy on their strategic nuclear weapons from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200.

The nuclear charge of deuterium is twice that of hydrogen, and this difference in nuclear charge produces a corresponding difference in the forces between the electrons and nucleus of the atom. The greater the separation between the electron and the nucleus, the greater the frequency of infrared absorption. The frequency of absorption of a given wavelength of infrared light will also depend on the strength of the bonds between the atoms, as well as the energy of the electrons.  The infrared absorption frequency for the bond</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: A</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: What are the names of Donald Duck's three nephews?</b><br>A: Quick Quack Quock<br>B: Alvin Simon Theodore<br>C: Robbie Chip Ernie<br>D: Huey Dewey Louie<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: D</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: What are the names of Donald Duck's three nephews?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: Huey, Duey and Louie  What is the name of the dog that Donald Duck lives with?
