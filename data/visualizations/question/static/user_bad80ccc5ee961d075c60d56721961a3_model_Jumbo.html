Buffer solutions do not change pH when more buffer is added.  **Difficulty:** Medium  **Category:** Equilibrium and Kinetics  **Getting to the Answer:** The pH of a buffer solution remains constant when more buffer is added.</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Doubling the volume of the buffer solution by adding water has what effect on its pH</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: ? The pH of a solution is determined by the concentration of H+ ions. If more H+ ions are added, the pH will rise, since there are more H+ ions. Therefore, the pH of the buffer solution will increase. What is the pH of a solution containing 0.25 moles of HC2H3O2?</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: What were the 'open-door notes'?</b><br>A: An American declaration that the US was always open to Chinese immigration<br>B: An American proclamation that China should be divided up between the US, Japan and the European empires<br>C: An American proclamation that China should be open to US trade and missionaries<br>D: An American declaration of support for Chinese economic protectionism<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: C</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: open-door notes</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: : A Sunday post, at last!

In 2016, Hillary Clinton said the US was "not second-guessing" China's decision to relax the policy.
