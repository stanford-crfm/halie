Infrared absorption frequency of deuterium chloride is shifted from that of hydrogen chloride is due to which one?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The deuterium chloride molecule has a higher dipole moment than the hydrogen chloride molecule. This leads to a stronger interaction between the electric fields of the molecules, and hence a higher infrared absorption frequency.</i></div><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: Infrared absorption frequency of deuterium chloride is shifted from that of hydrogen chloride is due to which one?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: The difference in the infrared absorption frequency of deuterium chloride and hydrogen chloride is due to the difference in the masses of the two atoms. Deuterium has a mass that is twice that of hydrogen, so its absorption frequency is shifted from that of hydrogen by a factor of 2.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: D</div><br><hr><br><div class='question' style='background-color:#fca503'><b>QUESTION: As of 2015, about what percentage of the world’s land area is forested?</b><br>A: 15%<br>B: 30%<br>C: 45%<br>D: 60%<br></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>True Answer: B</div><br><div class='answer' style='background-color:#ffc75e'><b><i>USER PROMPT: As of 2015, which percent of the world's land is forested?</i></b><br><i>MODEL RESPONSE: As of 2015, about 30 percent of the world's land is forested.</i></div><div style='background-color:#fcb93a'>User Answer: B</div><br><hr>
