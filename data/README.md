# Data in HALIE

Our documentation is still under construction. Please reach out to [Mina Lee](https://minalee.info/) at `minalee@stanford.edu` if you have any question or suggestion for improvement.


## Raw data
Raw data contains the raw interaction traces collected for each task, including all logged interaction traces (`logs.zip`) as well as survey questions and responses.  

## Visualizations
To facilitate easier viewing of the raw interaction data, we provide both `static` and dynamic `replay` visualizations, which are directly viewable in any browser after downlading this repository. Both static and replay visualzations are available  for the **Crossword puzzles** task, and static visualizations are available for the **Question answering** task. 

To make it easier to browse through these interactive visualizations, we have created the following web applications:

- [Crossword Puzzle Visualizations](https://meghabyte.github.io/visualizations-halie/visualizations/crossword/)
- [Question Answering Visualizations](https://meghabyte.github.io/visualizations-halie/visualizations/questions/)


For any questions about the data visualizations for the **Question answering** or **Crossword puzzle** tasks, feel free to reach out to [Megha Srivastava](https://web.stanford.edu/~meghas/) at `megha@cs.stanford.edu`!

## Standardized data

To faciliate the analysis of events between humans and LMs across hundreds of interaction sessions, we standardize the data for each task to based on the raw data we collected.
Each task has `event_blocks.csv` and `survey_responses.csv` as well as a few extra files depending on the task.

**Event blocks.** The `event_blocks.csv` file contains the event blocks (i.e., a sequence of events of our interest) that occurred during interaction. The definition of an event block varies by task. Here is how we defined event blocks for each task:

- Social dialogue: each turn is an event block (user writes one message)
- Question answering: each question and answer pair is an event block (user answers a question by querying a system zero or more times)
- Crossword puzzles: each query to the system is an event block (user queries a system once to brainstorm about a clue)
- Text summarization: each original document, machine-generated summary, and edited summary pair is an event block (user edits a machine-generated summary of a document)
- Metaphor generation: each metaphorical sentence is an event block (user writes a metaphorical sentence by querying a system zero or more times)

Our standardized data also includes some relevant statistics, such as the number of queries, the elapsed time, etc. for each event block.

For implementation details, please refer to the `*_block.py` files in `./src/blocks` for each task.

**Survey responses.** the `survey_responses.csv` file contains the survey responses collected after the task.
