I stopped to email a screenshot of this error through the MTurk platform so I had to use my Worker ID in both this survey as well as on the HIT task itself for that portion. I will also email with the screenshot to the email address provided in the error pop-up window afterwards. I would appreciate your understanding in this matter given that it is late at night so I don't feel I have any choice but to use my Worker ID to ensure that this information is intact as well as to ensure I receive compensation. I did enjoy the challenge of interacting with the AI assistant. Good luck with your research.,The AI Assistant was helpful if I worded myself appropriately. There were a few questions where I had to play with queries to get an answer that felt proper. I think it is similar to doing an internet search where the results are often only as good as the information put in as the query. The question regarding fat soluble vitamins was particularly challenging to get an answer that I felt more confident in selecting given the various information that was discovered.

I have a decent amount of experience with these types of assistants.,I always love interacting with HITs such as this! I was paying attention to the left side of the panel(answering the questions) and missed exactly when it was enabled. Maybe add some sort of popup or notification that alerts the worker when this section becomes enabled.,Even when the answers were not specifically telling me the information I needed I could figure out the correct answer. Added confidence to my selections.
