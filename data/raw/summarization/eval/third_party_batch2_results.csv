About 50 jobs could be created by the two-phase development being proposed by Mossburn Distillers. The project needs clearance from the Scottish government due to potential flooding issues raised by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The first phase of the development between 2017 and 2018 would see a small distillery built to educate visitors in the ""craft of making spirit"". A larger-scale distillery, capable of producing millions of bottles per year, would be completed by 2021.","Plans for a Mossburn Distillery near Jedforest Hotel are in the works once clearance is given from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.","edited_output","ai21/j1-jumbo","false","false","false","false","true","true","false","false","false","false","false","true"

One migrant is reported to have died and several others were airlifted for medical treatment. According to the International Organization for Migration, some 132,000 migrants have arrived in Italy this year. Nearly 200 minors were saved from one of the boats, which was crammed with some 720 people. Most of the children were unaccompanied. The rescue comes exactly three years after 366 migrants died when an overcrowded boat sank off the Italian coast. The scale of that disaster brought attention to the plight of migrants making dangerous journeys at the mercy of smugglers.","The migrants had set off from the Libyan coast in nearly 40 boats.","initial_output","openai/text-babbage-001","false","false","true","false","false","true","false","false","false","false","true","false"
